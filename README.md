This Repository is dedicated as the main source control for our project - CheckYourCar Website.

Details of the project are:

This project involves a system that lets a user either use a website to fill a given form with specific vehicle make details, which they will then be shown details of issues/recalls depending on the car make, or users may register to the website through a portal, in which allows the user to register their car make, and in turn receive an email or other notification if their car has a new issue. Given the scenario of the client requirements, a system must be designed and delivered with user experience and precise information in mind.
The company itself would also like a database in which they can easily transport current vehicle information from spreadsheets into the database, which can be retrieved and manipulated easily.
Several technologies and services may be used to enable the interoperable communication between website, database, IFTTT protocols and more.
The project will be handled by a team using an Agile Scrum methodology, ensuring efficient and optimal workflow using Trello boards, source control measures like GitHub, Team Communication platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google collab et. Sprints will be planned in accordance with current developer knowledge, time constraints and product backlog requirements.
